Project One: Single Neuron
Purpose: To look at the resource limitations using different activation functions and other associated parameters
Status: Unable to progress, insufficient information pertaining to the lack of information on bits of the single neuron implementation. Elaborated design looks complete but synthesized design lacks logic gates, 63LUT/66FF vs 130LUT/66FF. Suspect individual IP logic lacking on YouTube/Tutorial especially the memory implementation, due to differences in LUT usage. AXI memory interface is likely the cause. Skipping to P2 for now.
Uses: Files from T1/T2. 

Project Two: Replicated Simulation of Example Network
Purpose: Simulate the provided and pre-trained network.
Status: On-going.
Uses: Files from
